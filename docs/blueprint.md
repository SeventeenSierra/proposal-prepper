## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) to convey trust and authority, suitable for the application's core focus on governance and compliance.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), almost white, to provide a clean, modern backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Purple (#7C3AED) to add visual interest and highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, objective and readable feel.
- Use a set of consistent, professional icons to represent various compliance categories, file types, and actions. Example library: Lucide
- Emphasize a clear and structured layout that facilitates ease of use. The dashboard should provide an immediate overview of proposal compliance. Results are rendered alongside document extracts in a preview pane.
- Use subtle transitions to enhance user experience such as progress updates that fade in with zoom, especially when document analysis is performed. All animation is used sparingly to provide maximal impact without distracting users.
