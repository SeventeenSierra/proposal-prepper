# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the Testing component of the Proposal Prepper base application, establishing comprehensive testing strategies, quality assurance procedures, and validation frameworks for the FAR compliance validation system. The testing framework ensures reliability, accuracy, and performance of compliance validation capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Unit_Testing**: Component-level testing for individual functions and modules
- **Integration_Testing**: Testing of service interactions and API integrations
- **End_to_End_Testing**: Complete workflow testing from proposal upload to compliance results
- **Performance_Testing**: Load testing and performance validation under various conditions
- **Compliance_Testing**: Validation of compliance analysis accuracy and regulatory adherence
- **Security_Testing**: Security vulnerability testing and penetration testing
- **User_Acceptance_Testing**: Validation of user workflows and acceptance criteria

## Requirements Classification

### Threshold Requirements (Must-Have for Base App)
- **Requirement 1**: Comprehensive unit testing (essential code quality)
- **Requirement 2**: End-to-end testing (essential user workflow validation)
- **Requirement 3**: Component testing (essential UI component validation)
- **Requirement 7**: Security testing (essential for OpenSSF Baseline SAST and vulnerability scanning)

### Objective Requirements (Future Enhancement)
- **Requirement 1**: Comprehensive unit testing (essential code quality)
- **Requirement 2**: End-to-end testing (essential user workflow validation)
- **Requirement 3**: Component testing (essential UI component validation)
- **Requirement 4**: Integration testing (advanced service integration validation)
- **Requirement 5**: Performance testing (performance validation)
- **Requirement 6**: Compliance testing (compliance validation accuracy)
- **Requirement 7**: Security testing (security vulnerability validation)
- **Requirement 8**: User acceptance testing (user workflow validation)
