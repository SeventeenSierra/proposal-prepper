# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the Operations component of the Proposal Prepper base application, establishing operational procedures, monitoring, maintenance, and support capabilities for the FAR compliance validation system. The operations framework ensures reliable system operation, proactive issue detection, and efficient problem resolution.

## Glossary

- **System_Operations**: Day-to-day operational procedures and system management tasks
- **Monitoring_Operations**: Continuous monitoring of system health, performance, and availability
- **Maintenance_Operations**: Scheduled and reactive maintenance procedures for system upkeep
- **Incident_Management**: Procedures for detecting, responding to, and resolving system incidents
- **Backup_Operations**: Data backup, recovery, and disaster recovery procedures
- **Performance_Management**: Performance monitoring, optimization, and capacity planning
- **Security_Operations**: Security monitoring, threat detection, and response procedures

## Requirements Classification

### Threshold Requirements (Must-Have for Base App)
- None - All operations requirements are objectives for future operational maturity

### Objective Requirements (Future Enhancement)
- **Requirement 1**: System operations procedures (operational foundation)
- **Requirement 2**: Continuous monitoring capabilities (advanced monitoring)
- **Requirement 3**: Structured maintenance procedures (operational efficiency)
- **Requirement 4**: Incident management capabilities (reliability management)
- **Requirement 5**: Comprehensive backup operations (data protection)
- **Requirement 6**: Performance management capabilities (performance optimization)
- **Requirement 7**: Security operations capabilities (advanced security)
- **Requirement 8**: Operational analytics and reporting (operational intelligence)
- **Requirement 9**: User support operations (customer support)
- **Requirement 10**: Operational compliance capabilities (compliance management)
