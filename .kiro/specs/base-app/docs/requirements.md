# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the Documentation component of the Proposal Prepper base application, establishing comprehensive documentation for users, developers, and administrators of the FAR compliance validation system. The documentation provides clear guidance for installation, usage, development, and troubleshooting.

## Glossary

- **User_Documentation**: End-user guides for proposal validation and compliance checking
- **Developer_Documentation**: Technical documentation for contributors and integrators
- **API_Documentation**: Comprehensive API reference and integration guides
- **Installation_Guides**: Step-by-step deployment and setup instructions
- **Troubleshooting_Guides**: Problem resolution and diagnostic procedures
- **Compliance_Documentation**: FAR/DFARS requirement explanations and validation guidance
- **Maintenance_Documentation**: System administration and maintenance procedures

## Requirements Classification

### Threshold Requirements (Must-Have for Base App)
- None - All documentation requirements are objectives for future enhancement

### Objective Requirements (Future Enhancement)
- **Requirement 1**: Comprehensive user documentation (user guidance)
- **Requirement 4**: Installation guides (deployment support)
- **Requirement 2**: Technical documentation (developer experience)
- **Requirement 3**: API documentation (integration support)
- **Requirement 5**: Troubleshooting documentation (support efficiency)
- **Requirement 6**: Compliance documentation (compliance guidance)
- **Requirement 7**: Maintenance documentation (operational support)
- **Requirement 8**: Documentation management tools (content management)
- **Requirement 9**: Searchable and accessible documentation (user experience)
- **Requirement 10**: Documentation analytics (content optimization)
