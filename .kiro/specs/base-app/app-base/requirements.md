# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the Proposal Prepper (Contract Checker) Next.js web application for federal vendor proposal compliance checking. The application provides a user interface for analyzing federal procurement proposals against FAR/DFARS regulations and Executive Orders using a Federated Mesh architecture to orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents while providing transparent, educational analysis results with government-grade security and audit capabilities.

- **FAR_DFARS**: Federal Acquisition Regulation and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement containing federal procurement compliance requirements
- **Executive_Orders**: Presidential directives that add additional compliance layers to federal procurement
- **Federated_Mesh**: A microservices architecture pattern where the web app orchestrates multiple AI services for federal procurement compliance
- **Agent_Interface**: An interactive AI assistant component for proposal guidance and recommendations
- **Compliance_Analysis**: Automated validation of vendor proposals against FAR/DFARS requirements and Executive Orders with evidence-based results
- **Multi_Agent_Architecture**: Specialized AI agents including FAR Agent, Executive Order Agent, and Technical Agent

5. WHERE regulatory interpretation is needed, THE Agent_Interface SHALL provide educational explanations with specific FAR/DFARS citations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Federal Contractor, I want to see detailed compliance reports with dual-analysis validation, so that I can understand exactly what needs to be fixed in my proposal with confidence in the assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing compliance reports, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL display dual-analysis results (tactical FAR compliance and strategic regulatory framework) with convergent validation
2. WHEN showing findings, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL organize results by risk classification (critical vs. secondary deficiencies) with clear severity indicators
3. WHEN presenting evidence, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL show exact proposal text quotes with specific FAR/DFARS citations and page references
4. WHEN displaying recommendations, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL provide prioritized remediation steps with specific timelines (0-10 days for critical actions)
5. WHERE critical gaps exist, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL highlight non-waivable requirements that create immediate rejection risk

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Federal Contractor, I want transparent AI analysis with regulatory currency tracking, so that I can understand how different AI agents contribute to compliance checking and trust the assessment currency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying AI results, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL show which specialized agent (FAR Agent, Executive Order Agent, Technical Agent) provided each analysis
2. WHEN presenting findings, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL include provenance tags showing the source agent and regulatory update date for each recommendation
3. WHEN orchestrating agents, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL coordinate multiple specialized compliance agents through the Federated Mesh architecture
4. WHEN agents provide conflicting assessments, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL present both analyses with confidence scores and let users make informed decisions
5. WHERE regulatory currency matters, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL display the "as-of" date for all FAR/DFARS references and Executive Order compliance checks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Federal Contractor, I want a responsive and accessible interface, so that I can use the application effectively across different devices and accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the interface, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL provide responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN navigating the application, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL include accessible navigation with proper ARIA labels and keyboard support
3. WHEN displaying content, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL use semantic HTML and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
4. WHEN providing feedback, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL use toast notifications and proper form validation with clear error messages
5. WHERE visual elements are used, THE Proposal_Prepper SHALL provide alternative text and ensure sufficient color contrast
