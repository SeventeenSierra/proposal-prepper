# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the Security component of the Proposal Prepper base application, establishing security controls, threat protection, and data security for the FAR compliance validation system. The security framework protects sensitive proposal data and ensures secure operation in federal contractor environments.

## Glossary

- **Data_Security**: Protection of proposal documents and sensitive information through encryption and access controls
- **Authentication_Security**: User authentication and identity management systems
- **Authorization_Controls**: Role-based access controls and permission management
- **Network_Security**: Protection of network communications and infrastructure
- **Threat_Protection**: Detection and prevention of security threats and attacks
- **Audit_Security**: Security logging, monitoring, and compliance reporting
- **Incident_Response**: Security incident detection, response, and recovery procedures

## Requirements Classification

### Threshold Requirements (Must-Have for Base App)
- **Requirement 1**: Secure data protection (essential security)

### Objective Requirements (Future Enhancement)
- All other security requirements will be defined as objectives for enhanced security posture

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Federal Contractor, I want secure data protection, so that I can trust that my sensitive proposal information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data, THE Data_Security SHALL encrypt all proposal documents and sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN transmitting data, THE Data_Security SHALL encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3 or higher
3. WHEN handling PII, THE Data_Security SHALL implement data classification and protection based on sensitivity levels
4. WHEN managing keys, THE Data_Security SHALL provide secure key management and rotation procedures
5. WHERE data disposal is needed, THE Data_Security SHALL implement secure data deletion and sanitization procedures
