# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the App Enhancement component of the Proposal Prepper base application, establishing the foundation for future feature development including dual compliance services (NSF/FAR), enhanced agent coordination, service selection interfaces, and unified results display. These enhancements build upon the base NSF compliance functionality to create a more comprehensive proposal validation platform.

## Glossary

- **Dual_Compliance**: Support for both NSF PAPPG and FAR/DFARS compliance validation within the same application
- **Service_Selection**: User interface for choosing between different compliance validation services
- **Enhanced_Coordination**: Improved AI agent orchestration for complex multi-domain compliance analysis
- **Unified_Results**: Consolidated display of validation results from multiple compliance domains
- **Feature_Extensibility**: Architecture patterns that support adding new compliance domains and validation services
- **Progressive_Enhancement**: Incremental feature rollout that maintains backward compatibility
- **Multi_Domain_Analysis**: Capability to analyze proposals against multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously

## Requirements Classification
