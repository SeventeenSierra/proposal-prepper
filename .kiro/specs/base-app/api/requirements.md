# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the API component of the Proposal Prepper base application, establishing the REST API endpoints, GraphQL schema, and service integration patterns that enable communication between the Next.js web application and the Python/Node.js microservices. The API layer provides secure, efficient data exchange for proposal validation, compliance analysis, and AI orchestration.

## Glossary

- **REST_API**: RESTful endpoints for proposal submission, validation requests, and result retrieval
- **GraphQL_Schema**: Type-safe API schema for complex data queries and real-time updates
- **Service_Integration**: API patterns for communication between web and strands (Python) services
- **API_Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection for API endpoints
- **Rate_Limiting**: Request throttling and quota management for API usage
- **API_Documentation**: OpenAPI specifications and developer documentation
- **Error_Handling**: Consistent error responses and status codes across all endpoints

## Requirements Classification

### Threshold Requirements (Must-Have for Base App)
- None (all API requirements are objective enhancements)

### Objective Requirements (Future Enhancement)
- **Requirement 1**: REST API endpoints for proposal operations (core functionality)
- **Requirement 2**: GraphQL API for complex queries (advanced querying)
- **Requirement 3**: Service integration patterns (essential architecture)
- **Requirement 4**: API security controls (security requirement)
- **Requirement 5**: API documentation (developer experience)
- **Requirement 6**: API monitoring and management (operations)
- **Requirement 7**: Consistent error handling (quality improvement)
- **Requirement 8**: API optimization features (performance)
- **Requirement 9**: Webhook capabilities (integration features)
- **Requirement 10**: API analytics endpoints (metrics and reporting)
