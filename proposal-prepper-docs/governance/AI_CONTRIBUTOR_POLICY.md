# AI Contributor Policy

This policy defines how autonomous AI agents participate in development of the Proposal Prepper (Contract Checker) project.

## Table of Contents

1. [Core Principles](#core-principles)
2. [Trust Zones Overview](#trust-zones-overview)
3. [Approved AI Agents](#approved-ai-agents)
4. [Commit Standards](#commit-standards)
5. [Human Involvement Framework](#human-involvement-framework)

7. [Project-Specific Guidelines](#project-specific-guidelines)
8. [Validation & Examples](#validation--examples)
9. [Legal Considerations](#legal-considerations)
10. [Enforcement](#enforcement)

## Core Principles

1. **AI is a tool, not an author** - Humans are always responsible for AI contributions
2. **Transparency** - All AI involvement is tracked and visible
3. **Graduated autonomy** - Trust zones define what AI can do autonomously
4. **Audit trail** - Every AI action is logged for accountability

## Trust Zones Overview

See [.ai-zones.yaml](/.ai-zones.yaml) for authoritative configuration.

| Zone | Auto-merge | Human Involvement | Typical Files |
|------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Zone 0: Full Autonomy | ✅ | None | Lock files, changelogs |
| Zone 1: After CI | ✅ | Notified | Tests, docs, UI components |
| Zone 2: Review Required | ❌ | 1 approval | Features, service code |
| Zone 3: Security Review | ❌ | 2 approvals | Auth, crypto, workflows |
| Zone 4: Human Only | ❌ | AI blocked | Legal docs, configs |

## Commit Standards

### Required Format

All AI-authored commits must follow conventional commit format with required trailers:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body explaining the change]

[optional footer(s)]

AI-Agent: <agent-name>
Human-Involvement: <level>
Signed-off-by: Human Sponsor <human@seventeensierra.com>
```

### Conventional Commit Types & Scopes

| Type | Purpose | Common Scopes | Example |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | web, strands, ui, compliance | `feat(web): add NSF compliance dashboard` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | web, strands, api, components | `fix(api): resolve validation error` |
| `docs` | Documentation | docs, web, ui, lib | `docs(readme): update setup instructions` |
| `style` | Code formatting | web, ui, components | `style(ui): apply biome formatting` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | web, strands, orchestration | `refactor(orchestration): extract validation logic` |
| `test` | Testing | tests, web, strands, compliance | `test(compliance): add NSF validation tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | deps, config, ci | `chore(deps): update dependencies` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | ci, docker, railway, security | `ci(docker): add security workflow` |
| `perf` | Performance | web, strands, orchestration | `perf(orchestration): optimize mesh routing` |
| `build` | Build system | docker, railway, config | `build(docker): update compose config` |
| `revert` | Revert commit | any scope | `revert(web): revert dashboard changes` |

### Microservice Scopes

| Category | Scopes | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Services** | `web`, `strands` | Federated Mesh services |
| **Packages** | `ui`, `lib` | Shared component libraries |
| **Infrastructure** | `docker`, `railway`, `ci`, `deps` | Deployment and tooling |
| **Business Logic** | `compliance`, `orchestration`, `api` | Core functionality |
| **Development** | `components`, `tests`, `docs`, `config` | Development workflow |
| **Data** | `seed`, `schemas` | Data and type definitions |
| **Security** | `security` | Security configurations |

## Human Involvement Framework

### Involvement Levels Defined

| Level | Definition | When to Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `full` | Human wrote code, AI assisted | Complex logic, architecture decisions |
| `reviewed` | AI wrote, human reviewed line-by-line | Features, fixes, critical changes |
| `approved` | AI wrote, human approved without line review | Documentation, tests, formatting |
| `automated` | Fully autonomous, no human involvement | Dependency updates, lock files |

### Commit Type Requirements

Different commit types require different oversight levels based on risk:

| Commit Type | Min. Human Involvement | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **High Risk** | | |
| `feat` | `reviewed` | New features affect user experience |
| `fix` | `reviewed` | Bug fixes can introduce regressions |
| `refactor` | `reviewed` | Code restructuring can introduce bugs |
| `ci` | `reviewed` | CI/CD changes affect deployment security |
| `perf` | `reviewed` | Performance changes affect system behavior |
| **Medium Risk** | | |
| `docs` | `approved` | Documentation needs accuracy check |
| `test` | `approved` | Tests improve quality, low production risk |
| `chore` | `approved` | Maintenance tasks are typically safe |
| `build` | `approved` | Build configs are usually low-risk |
| `style` | `approved` | Formatting changes are mechanical |

### Zone Override Matrix

Zones can elevate requirements beyond commit type minimums:

| Zone | Override Rule | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Zone 0** | Always `automated` | Lock files, changelogs |
| **Zone 1** | Minimum `approved` | UI components, tests |
| **Zone 2** | Minimum `reviewed` | Service code, features |
| **Zone 3** | Always `full` | Security, auth, crypto |
| **Zone 4** | Always `full` | Legal docs, core configs |

## Legal Considerations

### Copyright
- AI-generated code cannot be copyrighted by AI (Thaler v. Perlmutter, 2023)
- Copyright belongs to human sponsor who directed the AI
- Human sponsor must have signed the CLA

### CLA
- AI cannot sign legal agreements
- Human sponsor signs on behalf of AI contributions
- Sponsor assumes responsibility for AI output

### DCO
- Human sponsor must sign off (`Signed-off-by:`)
- This attests the human authorized the AI to make these changes

## Approved AI Agents

```

See [.agent/config.yaml](/.agent/config.yaml) for full configuration.

## Branch & Workflow Rules

### Branch Access Permissions

| Branch Pattern | AI Direct Push | Allowed Commit Types | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Feature Branches** | | | |
| `feature/*` | ✅ Yes | `feat`, `docs`, `test` | Feature development from develop |
| `fix/*` | ✅ Yes | `fix`, `test`, `docs` | Bug fixes from develop |
| `docs/*` | ✅ Yes | `docs`, `style` | Documentation updates |
| `refactor/*` | ✅ Yes | `refactor`, `test`, `docs` | Code improvements |
| `test/*` | ✅ Yes | `test`, `docs` | Test additions |
| `chore/*` | ✅ Yes | `chore`, `ci`, `build` | Maintenance |
| **Protected Branches** | | | |
| `develop` | ❌ PR only | All types (via PR) | Integration branch - main development |
| `release/*` | ❌ PR only | `chore`, `docs`, `fix` only | Release preparation from develop |
| `hotfix/*` | ❌ PR only | `fix` only | Critical fixes from main |
| `main` | ❌ Never | Human only | Production releases only |

### Scope Validation Rules

AI agents must use appropriate scopes based on the files being modified:

| File Pattern | Required Scope | Zone |
|--------------|----------------|------|
| `apps/web/**` | `web` | 2+ |
| `services/strands-agent/**` | `strands` | 3 (security) |
| `packages/ui/**` | `ui` | 1+ |
| `packages/lib/**` | `lib` | 1+ |
| `docker-compose.yml` | `docker` | 4 (human-only) |
| `railway.toml` | `railway` | 4 (human-only) |
| `.github/workflows/**` | `ci` | 3 (security) |
| `**/*.md` | `docs` | 1+ |
| `**/package.json` | `deps` | 0+ |

### Workflow Requirements

1. **Scope-Path Validation**: Commit scope must match modified file paths
2. **Feature branches**: AI can push directly (subject to zone rules)
3. **Pull requests**: Required for protected branches
4. **Code review**: Automatic based on zone, commit type, and scope
5. **CI validation**: Must pass before any merge
6. **Human sign-off**: Required for all AI contributions

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Federated Mesh Architecture

| Component | Zone | Special Rules |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Service APIs** | Zone 2+ | Cross-service changes need human review |
| **Service Integration** | Zone 3 | Security review for service-to-service auth |
| **Orchestration Logic** | Zone 2 | Business logic requires human oversight |

### NSF PAPPG 23-1 Compliance

| Component | Zone | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Compliance Logic** | Zone 2+ | Core business functionality |
| **SOP Files** | Zone 3 | Claude 3.5 Sonnet instructions are security-sensitive |
| **Seed Data** | Zone 1 | Test data is low-risk |
| **Validation Rules** | Zone 2+ | Affects compliance accuracy |

### Infrastructure & Deployment

| Component | Zone | Access Level |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Railway Config** | Zone 4 | Human-only (deployment critical) |
| **Docker Compose** | Zone 4 | Human-only (local dev environment) |
| **Environment Templates** | Zone 2 | Reviewed (can affect security) |
| **Service Discovery** | Zone 3 | Security review (network configuration) |

feat(compliance): add new validation rule
AI-Agent: kiro
Human-Involvement: approved  # ❌ Should be 'reviewed' for feat
Scope: compliance
```

#### Wrong Zone for Commit Type
```bash
# ❌ INVALID: CI changes need proper review and security zone
ci(security): update gitleaks configuration
AI-Agent: cline
Human-Involvement: approved  # ❌ Should be 'reviewed' for ci
Zone: 1  # ❌ Security scope requires Zone 3
Scope: security
```

#### Invalid Scope for Commit Type
```bash
# ❌ INVALID: Style changes shouldn't affect strands service
style(strands): format Python code
AI-Agent: kiro
# ❌ Python service uses Black, not Biome
# ❌ Should use scope 'web' for style changes
```

#### Missing Required Trailers
```bash
# ❌ INVALID: Missing AI-Agent and Human-Involvement
feat(web): add compliance dashboard
# ❌ No AI agent trailers provided
```

#### Scope-Path Mismatch
```bash
# ❌ INVALID: Scope doesn't match file paths
feat(ui): add web app routing
# Files: apps/web/src/app/page.tsx
# ❌ Should be scope 'web', not 'ui'
```

## Enforcement

1. **Zone validation** runs on all PRs
2. **Commits without trailers** are flagged
3. **Human-only files** cannot be modified by bots
4. **Security zones** require security team review
5. **Microservice boundaries** are enforced via path restrictions
6. **Commit type validation** ensures appropriate human involvement levels
7. **Cross-validation** between commit type, zone, and human involvement
