# Design: Proposal Prepper

## Overview
This file provides design guidance for the Proposal Prepper (Contract Checker) microservice application. The system uses a **Federated Mesh architecture** to orchestrate NSF grant proposal compliance checking across multiple AI services.

For detailed information, see the organized documentation:
- **Repository Structure & Workflow**: See [repository.md](./repository.md)
- **Technology Stack & Infrastructure**: See [infrastructure.md](./infrastructure.md)  
- **Application Features & Architecture**: See [app.md](./app.md)

## Architectural Principles

### Federated Mesh Pattern
- **Service Independence**: Each AI service (AWS Strands, Google Genkit, Semantic Kernel) operates independently
- **Vendor Neutrality**: No lock-in to any single AI provider or platform
- **Transparent Orchestration**: Users see which service provided each analysis result
- **Component Provenance**: Every finding is tagged with its source service and model

## Design Principles

### User-Centered Design
- Prioritize user experience and workflow efficiency
- Minimize cognitive load with intuitive interfaces
- Provide clear feedback and guidance throughout the process

### Performance First
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals
- Implement efficient data loading strategies
- Use progressive enhancement techniques

### Accessibility by Default
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Provide proper semantic markup and ARIA labels

### Microservice Architecture
- **Service Separation**: Clear boundaries between UI, orchestration, and AI services
- **API-First Design**: Well-defined interfaces between services
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be deployed and scaled independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service uses the most appropriate technology stack

## Development Approach

### Design-First Workflow
1. **Design & Specification**: Create architecture and task breakdown before coding
2. **Section-Based Implementation**: Work in commit-bounded sections with review gates
3. **Fresh Context**: New conversations for each major section to prevent drift
4. **Human Review Gates**: Mandatory blocking checklists for all AI changes

### AI-Human Collaboration
- **Supervised Development**: AI assists with development under human oversight
- **Session Documentation**: Comprehensive records of decisions and rationale
- **Context Management**: Clear session boundaries prevent accumulated drift
- **Review Gates**: Human approval required for all significant changes

### Quality Assurance
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written before implementation
- **Best Practices**: Follows Next.js and React best practices
- **Automated Security**: Dependency scanning and vulnerability detection
- **Open Source License**: AGPL-3.0 for application code

### Iterative Development
1. **MVP**: Core proposal creation and editing
2. **Enhanced Features**: AI integration and templates
3. **Advanced Features**: Collaboration and analytics
4. **Optimization**: Performance and user experience refinements
