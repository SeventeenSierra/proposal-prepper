# Session Record: OBI Alignment & Context Consolidation
**Date**: 2025-12-27
**AI Model**: Antigravity (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
**Human**: afla
**Summary**: Starting Session 8 to combine the outcomes of the last two sessions (Security Hardening and Workflow Fixes) and align the OBI specifications accordingly.

## Decisions & Findings
1.  **Consolidation**: The project has been hardened with secure UUIDs, path sanitization, and port protection.
2.  **Workflow**: The `randomUUID` error was resolved, and the 7-step analysis granularity is ready for integration into the spec docs.
3.  **OBI Phase 1**: Focusing on aligning `design.md`, `requirements.md`, and `tasks.md` in `.kiro/specs obi/phase-1`.

## Files Modified/Created
- `.agent/sessions/8-obi-alignment/session-record.md` (Created)
- `task.md` (Artifact)

## Architecture Context
The application is moving towards a fully hardened, Docker-ready environment with granular analysis feedback.
